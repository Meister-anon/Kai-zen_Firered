typing sucks,  I'm removing the fighting type, and making them dark,
they're already dark anway.
 
 new types will be dark fighting,   dark fire & dark water

will also need to change their moveset

they removed its normal type but then didn't change its learnset besides
adding  2 type moves to the learnset of each that   relate to the secondary typing.

blaze gets a fire move at 15 & 55

aqua gets a water move at 15 & 55

and ironically combat gets a DARK move at 15 -_-  and not a fighting move.

they all learn close combat at 60, but other than that and double kick, get
ZERO other fihting moves in the learnset.

its still mostly normal moves that now no longer receive stab,
so its offensively much weaker, now a fightin type so defensively much weaker as well.
